# Typescript Jungle
The idea of this Project it not to make anything useful but to learn and grow as a developer
The idea behind it is to build and entire full stack projects using Typescript without a single
framework being used. Why would anyone be so crazy when there so many Amazing frameworks to
make ones life easier and reduce code? Well, call me crazy if you like but this project is a bit of 
fun designed to learn how these things work under the hood, removing the layer of abstraction 
so to better understand the how, and the why's of any framework.

The pages themselves will be whatever madness ascends from the depths of my imagination so they
, might be educational, or just out right silly. Again I specify the purpose of this site is not
to attract users but to grow and learn my full stack skills using nothing but Typescript.

## Learning Objectives prior to implementation
* Properly Learn Typescript.
* Improve SCSS Skills.
* Project Setup without a Framework.
* Architecture and Best Practices.
* ES6 Modules.
* Practical Fullstack Theories.
